			<p> Homelessness has been an on-going problem in the United States over the past decade. This can be caused by a number of factors, including poverty, mental illness, and unaffordable housing. Average homelessness rates have decreased since the Great Recession, but continue to be a problem in current day. </p>
			<p> In 2015, government funding towards fighting homelessness reaching an all-time high, clocking in at $4.5 billion. This aid has resulted in an overall decrease. However, as rents reach all time highs in large cities such as Denver and San Francisco, homelessness continues to be a problem.  </p>
